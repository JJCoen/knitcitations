Dear CRAN Maintainers,

Minor bugfix to migrate to PCRE2 regex support.  I have also removed the spuriously included .bib file in the original submission of this release yesterday.  That release also indicated a 502 URL resolution error at the Open Source Initiative's website.  Please note that this was a chance occurance, and the the http://opensource.org is indeed a valid and well known website address, so I have made no change to this URL.


Sincerely,

Carl
